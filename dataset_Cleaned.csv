The Artificial Intelligence (AI) Residency Program is a one-year research training position designed to give you hands-on experience with artificial intelligence research while working in Facebook AI. This program is designed for applicants who seek advanced experience in artificial intelligence research, under the mentorship of an established researcher, with the long-term goal of obtaining an AI research scientist/engineer role. The AI Residency application is open to all fields of study, including areas ostensibly unrelated to machine learning such as (but not limited to) math, physics, finance, economics, linguistics, computational social science, neuroscience and bioinformatics. We seek people from a diverse range of technical backgrounds who have prior coding experience and are passionate about AI research. Candidates for the residency should have a foundational knowledge in ML and AI research, and have plans to pursue a career in research after completing the program. Candidates who already hold a PhD on an AI-related topic should consider other roles in Facebook.During your residency, we will pair you with an AI researcher who will act as your mentor and help guide your project. With your team, you will pick a research problem of mutual interest and then devise new AI techniques to solve it. We also encourage collaborations beyond the assigned mentor. The research will be communicated to the academic community by submitting papers to top academic venues (for example, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR, ICCV, ACL, EMNLP etc.), as well as open-source code releases and/or product impact. This is a full-time, 12-month program that cannot be undertaken in conjunction with university study or another job.Applications will close on Tuesday, January 18, 2022 at 5pm Pacific Time. The program will start in June 2022.
